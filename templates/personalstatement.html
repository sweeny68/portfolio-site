    <p>
        I am thrilled by the opportunity to apply for the Degree Apprenticeship in Computing Systems at Ulster University because I have always had a strong interest in computer science. My enthusiasm for the logical and mathematical aspects of the subject has only grown as I’ve explored new concepts during my A-level studies. I am particularly excited to study the diverse modules offered in this course, especially Data Analytics and Systems Security. The apprenticeship format appeals to me because it combines learning with practical experience, allowing me to apply my knowledge in real-world settings. I believe this approach will not only enhance my skills but also provide valuable industry experience that will help launch my career in computing.
    </p>
    <p>
        During my work placement at Kainos, I was first introduced to HTML and JavaScript, where I worked alongside other students to develop a front-end web application that was styled in CSS and had interactive JavaScript elements. This was my first insight into what developing front-end applications would be like in a professional environment. I also attended the Kainos Code Camp, where my JavaScript skills and HTML knowledge were further enhanced as the week progressed. Throughout the week, I continued to build upon my skills at home, where I began to develop my first portfolio website, <a style='color:#3b71ff' href="http://oranmcclintock.com" target="_blank">oranmcclintock.com</a>. The back end was built using the Python module Flask and hosted on PythonAnywhere. However, the front end was developed alongside my learning at Kainos. The experience I gained working on this project gave me a deeper understanding of what bigger programming projects involve, and I believe the Full-Stack Development module in Computing Systems at Ulster University will provide further insights into what software development is like in a professional environment. I also attended a three-day placement at Pytilia, where my Python skills were further developed through the creation of games.
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout my time at school, I have been involved in both academics and extracurricular activities, which helped me develop a well-rounded education. I was honoured to be recognized as the top achiever at GCSE level, which reflects my dedication and commitment to learning. In addition to my studies, I took on several leadership roles, such as serving as a Senior Prefect and Bus Prefect. I also organized and ran the Year 8 lunchtime IT club, where younger students began their programming journey using block-based languages like Scratch. These experiences taught me responsibility and improved my organizational skills, while allowing me to make a positive impact on my school community.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’ve also earned several sports awards, including the Thompson Cup, the McNamee Cup, the Nagle Cup, and the Forrester’s Cup. These awards show my commitment to teamwork and have given me the chance to represent my school with pride.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, I took part in the GAISCE President’s Award, which gave me valuable experiences that contributed to my personal growth and improved my ability to work in stressful environments.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alongside my education, I’ve been heavily involved in team sports like hurling and football with my local clubs. I’ve had the opportunity to compete at a high level, winning hurling titles such as: the All-Ireland Feile, U19 A Championship, Minor A Championship, Minor A League, and Darragh Cup. In football, I’ve also earned the titles: U19 B Championship and, more recently, the Laverty Cup. Competing in these sports has taught me how to handle pressure and work well in a team, all while keeping up with my schoolwork and achieving good exam results.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of sports, I work part-time in a few different roles. I’m a bartender at Cushendall Sailing & Boating Club, a shop attendant in Kearney’s Waterfoot, and a barista at the Beach Café in Glenariffe. Balancing three jobs with my studies and sports has sharpened my time management and made me more adaptable, helping me juggle my responsibilities without clashing with work, school, or training.
    </p>
    <p>
        At work, I’m responsible for things like closing the bar, compiling end-of-day reports, handling cash, and dealing with customers professionally. These tasks have given me a strong sense of responsibility and helped me develop solid communication and leadership skills.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am genuinely excited about the opportunities a degree apprenticeship from Ulster University will bring, as it will equip me with the skills and experience necessary for a successful career in the software industry. While I know it will be a challenging journey, I’m eager to take on the difficulties of developing innovative software systems, creating new applications, and optimizing everyday tasks through technology.
